# Web App

The package is very simple to use, all you need is a browser, like Chrome.

- [static mode](https://dongzhuoer.shinyapps.io/population-genetics-monte-carlo-simulation/)
- [dynamic mode](https://dongzhuoer.shinyapps.io/population-genetics-monte-carlo-simulation2/)

But if you can't stand the low speed and the limit on population size and generation number ^[Additionly, the connection may often break and you have to refresh.], you may consider the following approach.

# Run on your own computer

In this way, you can free from the above troubles. It's very easy, you just need to install R, which is even simpler than QQ.

1. install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (use [this](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) for Windows users.)

2. install this package

```r
if (!('devtools' %in% .packages(T))) install.packages('devtools');
remotes::install_github('dongzhuoer/pgmcs');
```

3. enjoy

- for static mode

```r
shiny::runGitHub('dongzhuoer/pgmcs', subdir = 'inst/shiny/population-genetics-monte-carlo-simulation')
```

- for dynamic mode

```r
shiny::runGitHub('dongzhuoer/pgmcs', subdir = 'inst/shiny/population-genetics-monte-carlo-simulation2')
```
